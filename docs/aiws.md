# AI Workforce Suite (AIWS)

## Overview

The AI Workforce Suite (AIWS) is a comprehensive framework for building and deploying specialized AI agent swarms across various industries and use cases. Each swarm is a collection of purpose-built agents designed to work together to automate and enhance specific domains. StarkHive, our DeFi-focused swarm for Starknet, represents the first implementation of this framework.

## Vision

AIWS aims to revolutionize workforce automation through modular, specialized AI swarms that can operate independently or in concert to handle complex tasks across different sectors. The framework provides the foundation for developing, deploying, and managing these intelligent agent networks.
